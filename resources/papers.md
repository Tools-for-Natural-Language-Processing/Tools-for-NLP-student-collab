# List of presentation papers

The papers are listed in chronological order of publication. All titles
are linked to the original publication page in the _Journal of Language
Modelling_.

Each seminar participant will choose one of the following papers to
study in a small group (typically three students) with the assistance
of AI. In the two presentation sessions at the end of the semester (as
detailed in the [syllabus](../README.md)), each group will present
their paper and discuss their strategies for using AI to enhance their
understanding of the topic. We are interested in both successful and
unsuccessful strategies, as well as the specific measures taken to
ensure factual accuracy.

The papers Hahn & Richter (2015) and Sadrzadeh & Muskens (2019) are
mainly intended for doctoral and postdoctoral students.
