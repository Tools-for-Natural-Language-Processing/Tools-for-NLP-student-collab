## Challenges you have been confronted with when using LLMs and the strategies that you employ to improve their output

In this file, feel free to add any challenges you have been confronted with while using LLMs to analyze a research paper, as well as, the strategies that you have employed to improve the accuracy or depth of the models' answers. Here are a few challenges and strategies that we have already mentioned in class. Feel free to expand the lists.


### Challenges:
1. Text summarization 
2. Graph Analysis
3. Counting of letters
4. Data annotation
5. The model does not have direct access to the data. / No Google search grounding
6. ...

### Strategies:
1. Prompting the model to solve a problem by breaking down the problem into smaller subtasks. <br>
 
2. Prompting the model to think step by step. <br>

3. Providing the model with an example/template to follow (in-context learning). <br>

4. ...
